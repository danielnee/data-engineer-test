# Data Engineer Test

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. You will find some example input files under src/main/resources. All input files are TSV files.
3. The file src/main/resources/sale.tsv provides some examples of output you can use as test cases.
4. Navigate to src/main/scala/com/test/SalesTransform.scala
5. Your job is to finish the implementation of this file
6. Implement the main function to read all data files in and transform them in RDD's of the case classes
7. The customer data of birth of has come from many systems. You need to clean this the DOB. You can assume that the examples in customer.tsv contain all the cases of formats of DOB.
8. Implement transformData to transform the data into Sale case class
9. Write the Sale RDD to a Parquet file
10. Return your final code to us as a zip file, along with any instructions on how to build. Please do not upload your code to a public Git Repo

## General Instructions

* Unit test as much as possible. You won't have access to a live cluster for this test, so think how you can test your code as much as possible
* Structure your code in a way you see fit (add new classes, split code into multiple files, change package structure etc.)
* Remember we may want to re-use logic e.g. we may need to transform the customer data in the same way in several locations. How would you structure your code to achieve this?
* Add any additional libraries you want to use
* If you make any assumptions, please comment about them in your code
* Example TSV files are included under resources. You can assume the columns and ordering of the case classes correspond exactly to the TSV's
